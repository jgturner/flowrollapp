# Authentication Implementation

This project now includes a complete authentication system using Supabase with the following features:

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. User Registration & Login

- **Registration Form** (`/register`): Complete user registration with profile creation

  - Email and password authentication
  - Profile information collection (first name, last name, belt level, height, weight, date of birth)
  - Automatic unit conversion (feet/inches to meters, pounds to kg)
  - Form validation and error handling

- **Login Form** (`/login`): User authentication
  - Email and password login
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Automatic redirect to feed page after successful login

### 2. Profile Management

- **Profile Pictures**: Upload and display user avatars

  - Click on profile picture in sidebar to upload new image
  - Automatic storage in Supabase Storage (avatars bucket)
  - Image validation (type and size limits)
  - Loading states during upload

- **User Information Display**:
  - Real user name and email in sidebar
  - Belt level display
  - Profile picture with fallback to initials

### 3. Protected Routes

- **Route Protection**: Authenticated access required for feed page
- **Automatic Redirects**: Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during auth checks

### 4. Navigation & User Experience

- **Automatic Navigation**: Users redirected to feed page after successful login/registration
- **Logout Functionality**: Sign out button in sidebar footer
- **Real-time Auth State**: Automatic UI updates when auth state changes

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The implementation uses two main tables:

### Auth Table (Supabase Auth)

- Handles user authentication (email, password, etc.)
- Managed automatically by Supabase

### Profiles Table (Custom)

- `id` - UUID (references auth.users.id)
- `first_name` - User's first name
- `last_name` - User's last name
- `belt_level` - BJJ belt rank (White, Blue, Purple, Brown, Black)
- `height` - Height in meters
- `weight` - Weight in kilograms
- `date_of_birth` - Date of birth
- `avatar_url` - Profile picture URL
- Additional fields for social media links, gym info, etc.

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

- ✅ Profiles table has RLS enabled
- ✅ Users can only read/write their own profile data
- ✅ Public read access for community features
- ✅ Special policies for gym owner verification

### Storage Security

- ✅ Avatars bucket configured for public access
- ✅ File type and size validation
- ✅ Unique file naming to prevent conflicts

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Variables**: Create `.env.local` file (see setup-env.md)
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js` (already done)
3. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`

## 🎯 Usage Flow

1. **New Users**:

   - Visit `/register` to create account
   - Fill out profile information
   - Automatically redirected to `/feed` after registration

2. **Existing Users**:

   - Visit `/login` to sign in
   - Automatically redirected to `/feed` after login

3. **Authenticated Users**:

   - Access protected routes like `/feed`
   - Upload profile pictures via sidebar
   - View personalized user information
   - Sign out when needed

4. **Profile Picture Upload**:
   - Click on avatar in sidebar
   - Select image file
   - Automatic upload to Supabase Storage
   - Real-time UI update

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Authentication Context

- Manages user state throughout the application
- Handles Supabase auth state changes
- Provides authentication functions to components

### Unit Conversions

- Height: Feet/inches → Meters (for database storage)
- Weight: Pounds → Kilograms (for database storage)
- Automatic conversion during registration

### Error Handling

- Form validation for all inputs
- Network error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for better UX

## 🚦 Next Steps

The authentication system is now fully functional. Users can:

- ✅ Register new accounts with complete profile information
- ✅ Login with email and password
- ✅ Access protected routes (feed page)
- ✅ Upload and display profile pictures
- ✅ View their information in the sidebar
- ✅ Sign out of the application

The system is ready for production use with proper security policies and error handling in place.
